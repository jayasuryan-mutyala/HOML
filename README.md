# Hands-On Machine Learning — Practice, Exercises & Review

This repository is a **structured learning workspace** for practicing, reviewing, and deeply understanding concepts from  
**Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and PyTorch** by *Aurélien Géron*.

The goal is **conceptual clarity + hands-on mastery**.

##  Purpose of This Repository

This repo is used to:

- Practice **core ML concepts** with real code
- Implement **end-of-chapter exercises**
- Rebuild key components (pipelines, transformers, models) **from scratch**
- Review mistakes, misunderstandings, and fixes
- Develop intuition behind **why** things work, not just *how*

This is intentionally **not a polished project repo** — it is a **learning lab**.
